	<header>
        Header element - Some header information goes here. Usually consists of company logo, some tag line etc. Sometimes, navigation is contained in the header as well.
        <nav>nav - it is the shorter form of navigation - Usually contains links to different parts of website.</nav>  
    </header>
    <h1>Welcome to this page</h1>
    <p>This is the paragraph of this page.</p>
    <div>DIV 1: Some content here, content in div is always in a separate line</div>
	<div>DIV 2: Following right after div1</div>
	<span>SPAN 1: Following right after div 2, though span is inline, it came to next line because it follows div which is always in a separate line</span>
	<div>
		DIV 3: Following right after span 1
		<span>SPAN 2: INSIDE div 3</span>
		Continue content after div 3. We donot use div regularly, instead we use other semantic elements that are block level elements like section, article, aside...etc.
	</div>
    <section>
        Section 1
        <article>Article 1, An article can have sections in it too</article>
        <article>Article 2</article>
        <article>Article 3</article>
    </section>
    <section>
        Section 2
        <article>Article 4</article>
        <article>Article 5</article>
        <article>Article 6</article>
    </section>
    <aside>Aside - some information that relates to the main topic, i.e., related posts.</aside>
    <div>
    	In div, all TAB and Enter are always ignored, so the following does give the output in a single line.
    </div>
    <div>
    	Shopping list:
    	Milk
    	Donuts
    	Cookies
    		Chocolates
    		Sugar
    		Peanut Butter
    	Pepsi
    </div>
    <div>
    	In order to write elemets as list, we use ul tag which indicates unorderedlist, li tag indicates the list elements.
    	<ul>
    		<li>Milk</li>
    		<li>Donuts</li>
    		<li>Cookies, it is further subdivided as follows</li>
    		<ul>
    			<li>Chocolates</li>
    			<li>Sugar</li>
    			<li>Peanut Butter</li>
    		</ul>
    		<li>Pepsi</li>
    	</ul>
    </div>
    <div>
    	If we want numbering so that the procedure is followed step wise from top to bottom like cooking, we use Ordered list.
    	<ol>
    		<li>Open Box</li>
    		<li>Take out cookies</li>
    		<li>Make a Double Oreo</li>
    		<ol>
    			<li>Peel off the top part</li>
    			<li>Place another cookie in the middle</li>
    			<li>Put back the top part</li>
    		</ol>
    		<li>Enjoy!!!!!!!!</li>
    	</ol>
